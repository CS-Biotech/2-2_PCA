    "Dimensionality reduction is a technique to reduce the number of features (characteristics, or input variables, etc.) of a dataset, while preserving the most important information.  \n",

    "*Why would we ever need to reduce the number of features in a dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. Suppose that we are analyzing a data set of breast cancer histopathology images. We have provided two images below. The left image contains benign breast cancer issues, whereas the right image contains malignant breast cancer tissues. Our goal is to determine whether an image contains benign or malignant breast cancer issues. How would you perform this prediction?\n",

    "You might notice that benign and breast cancer tissues have distinct characteristics, such as different ductal structures, nuclear morphologies, cell morphologies, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a computer, each image is represented as a 2-D grid of pixels. Each pixel provides a tiny piece of information through its color. You can think of the pixels in an image encoding some information about the breast cancer issue.\n",
    "We often consider each pixel of an image as a **feature**. The value of each feature is the color of the pixel converted to a number. (You may already be familiar with the term **features** under another name, \"variables\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each image has many pixels, only some pixels are important for determining whether the breast cancer issue is benign or malignent. We want to figure out and isolate the important pixels. Our ultimate goal is to preserve all the relevant features (pixels) that are required for classification and remove all the rest, ultimately reducing the dimensions of the data."

This is because PCA looks for directions of maximum variance to identify principal components.

If the first two components explain significantly more variance than the subsequent ones, this indicates that the dataset is essentially two-dimensional (almost all the variance can be explained by the first two principal components).

    "PCA is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional datasets. Each component of PCA is a weighted combination of the features in the dataset and represent the most significant patterns or gradients of variation in the data. Often, these components may also capture important variations that well seperate points by some target value, making PCA a tool for effective visualization and generating useful insights into the data's underlying structure.\n",

    "As a reminder, some good practices for using PCA include:\n",

    "\n",
    "Despite the benefits, one must also be careful regarding the interpretation of PCA. While the components discovered by PCA are informative and useful in many cases, it is also true that many real-world datasets contain *non-linear* patterns that PCA is unable to capture. For these, we need more advanced algorithms that we will cover in Week 3.\n",
